# Neko For Windows
Neko for Windows is a little white cat who runs around on the desktop and chases the mouse cursor. You can customise how Neko appears in many ways, and can even make him run on top of all other windows. Neko was ported by me from the original X-Windows source code that was written by Masayuki Koba.

For a detailed description of Neko's history, try the new Neko Fan Page.
